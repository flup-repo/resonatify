Please provide a detailed plan with step-by-step todos for developing a cross-platform scheduling application. The plan should cover the following aspects:

**Application Overview:**
*   Develop an application that allows users to configure and schedule audio files to run at specified times.
*   The application should function as a background process, similar to a cron job execution engine.

**Target Platforms:**
*   **Initial Release:** macOS.
*   **Future Releases:** Windows and Linux.

**Core Functionality:**
*   **Scheduling:** Enable users to configure a specific time and an action to execute.
*   **Initial Action:** The primary action will be to play an attached audio file.
*   **Settings & Personalization:** Implement functionality to save user settings and personalization preferences.

**User Interface:**
*   Design a nice, simple, and intuitive user interface. Research existing applications for UI inspiration and potential reuse of design patterns.

**Future Enhancements (to be considered in the plan for future features):**
*   **Expanded Actions:** Support additional actions such as opening applications, displaying messages, providing weather alerts, and setting reminders.
*   **In-App Audio Recording:** Allow users to record audio directly within the application.
*   **AI Integration:** Explore integration with an AI API (e.g., Perplexity) to enable AI-driven tasks as scheduled actions.

**Technical Considerations:**
*   Propose a suitable technology stack for a cross-platform desktop application, considering the initial macOS target and future expansion to Windows and Linux.
*   Outline a strategy for implementing background execution and scheduling.

**Monetization:**
*   Suggest a simple solution for accepting donations (e.g., PayPal integration).

**Research & Reference:**
*   Include a step for researching existing similar applications to gather insights and best practices.

The plan should be structured with clear phases (e.g., Planning, Design, Core Development, Future Features, Deployment) and detailed tasks within each phase.
